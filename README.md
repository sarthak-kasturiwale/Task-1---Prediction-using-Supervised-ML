# Student Percentage Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning

# Problem Statement
- Predict the percentage of an student based on the number of study hours.

# Results
- The Mean Absolute Error given by Support Vector Regression is Lowest amongst all tried algorithms, so we will choose the 'Support Vector Regression' model as a finalized model. It give MSE of 3.197500040038552.
- Generally, students who studies for more hours tend to score more. With the given dataset we find the exact same thing.
- There are certain cases where students did not score good even after studing for long hours.
- But these type of students are rare and they are getting this type of result because of some other reasons. To comment on them, we need some concrete data to make further analysis.
- For the analysis of the data set we have we can say that the 'hours of studies' is important for getting better 'Scores'.
